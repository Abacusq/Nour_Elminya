%% Drive with PID Control
%
% This example shows how to simulate a simple closed-loop control algorithm
% in Simulink(R) and how to run it on an Arduino(R) Uno board.

%% Introduction
%
% In a vehicle using independent wheel control, applying the same power to
% each wheel generally does not result in the vehicle moving straight. This
% is caused by mechanical and surface differences experienced by each of
% the wheels. To reduce deviation in the vehicle heading, a better approach
% is to use a closed-loop controller which adjusts the power applied to two
% motors based on the difference in their rates of rotation. One such
% controller is a well-known proportional–integral–derivative (PID)
% controller.
%
% PID control is a basic control loop feedback mechanism. The controller
% minimizes the difference between the measured and the desired value of a
% chosen system variable by adjusting the system control inputs.
%
% This example shows you how to simulate the controller using a simple
% plant model, first with no feedback control (Open-Loop Control), and then
% with feedback control (Closed-Loop Control). This example also
% illustrates how to switch between simulating the PID controller and
% running it on hardware in the same model.


%% Prerequisites
%
% We recommend completing
% <matlab:helpview(fullfile(realtime.internal.getArduinoUnoTargetRoot,'arduinounodemos','html','publish_arduinouno_gettingstarted.html'),'-helpbrowser') Getting Started with Arduino Uno Hardware>.
%


%% Required Hardware
% 
% To run this example you will need the following hardware:
% 
% Controller board:
% 
% * Arduino Uno board
% * USB cable
% 
% Motor controller parts:
% 
% * Texas Instruments(TM) SN754410 quadruple high-current half-H driver
% * Two 10 kOhm resistors
% * Small breadboard
% * Breadboard wires
% 
% A four-wheel vehicle:
% 
% * A mobile platform with four wheels powered by four DC motors
% * Two optical encoders wired to front DC motors
% * A battery pack consisting of five AA 1.5V batteries
% * A single pole, single throw (SPST) switch
% 
% Notes:
% 
% * This example was tested with the four-wheel vehicle built using DFRobot 
% 4WD Arduino-Compatible Platform w/Encoders. 
% * Other vehicle kits can be used as long as they have the same mechanical 
% characteristics (four wheels, four DC motors and two encoders). 
% * With a minor modification to the controller connections, a vehicle with 
% only two DC motors can be used as well.
% * Encoders used in this example are ten-step encoders. Different encoders
% can be used with minor modifications to the example models.

%% Task 1 - Build the Vehicle
%
% *1.* Assemble the mobile platform. Attach the two DC motors with encoders
% to the front wheels.
% 
% *2.* Attach the other two DC motors to the rear wheels. If your platform
% has only two DC motors, let the rear wheels rotate freely.
% 
% *3.* Assemble the battery pack and attach it to the mobile platform using
% suitable fasteners.
% 
% *4.* Connect the positive end of the battery pack to the switch using the 
% breadboard wires.
% 
% Note:
% If you are using DFRobot 4WD Arduino-Compatible Platform w/Encoders kit, 
% follow the vendor's instructions.


%% Task 2 - Build the Motor Controller
%
% The Arduino Uno board alone cannot provide high enough current to power
% DC motors. For that purpose, you will build the motor controller based on
% the Texas Instruments SN754410 quadruple high-current half-H driver.
% 
% *1.* Assemble the motor controller using the following circuit diagram.
% 
% <<arduinouno_pid.png>>
% 
% *2.* Connect the controller to the vehicle battery pack following the
% same circuit diagram.
%


%% Task 3 - Simulate Open-Loop Control Model
%
% This step illustrates that independently powered wheels cause deviations
% in vehicle heading.
%
% *1.* Open the <matlab:arduinouno_drive_openloop model>. Observe two 
% subsystems in the model.
%
% *2.* Open the *Open-Loop Controller* subsystem. This subsystem controls
% the vehicle driving. Observe that the controller does not use the
% difference between two encoder outputs to control the motors.
%
% *3.* Notice the *Motors* subsystem. The subsystem contains both simulated
% and actual motors. The Environment Controller block takes the outputs of
% the simulated or actual motors, depending on the current environment.
% This allows you to represent both simulated and actual motors in one
% model. As an alternative, you may create two models, one for simulation,
% and the other one for running on actual hardware.
%
% *4.* Click *Start simulation* in the Simulink toolbar. Click the *Scope*
% block and observe that the *Encoder Output Mismatch* increases over time.
% This indicates that the vehicle will not move straight.

%% Task 4 - Run Open-Loop Control Model on the Arduino Uno Board
%
% *1.* Disconnect the battery power wire leading to the Vin terminal on the
% Arduino Uno board since the board will get powered via a USB cable.
% 
% *2.* Connect the Arduino Uno board to your host computer using USB
% cable.
% 
% *3.* Select *Tools > Run on Target Hardware > Run* to download the
% example model.
% 
% *4.* After the model is downloaded, disconnect the USB cable from your
% Arduino Uno board. 
% 
% *5.* Connect back the battery power wire leading to the Vin terminal on
% your Arduino Uno board.
% 
% *6.* Place the vehicle on the ground and turn the vehicle switch on. The
% model runs on the board and the vehicle starts moving.
%
% *7.* Notice that the path of the vehicle is not straight, as predicted by
% the simulation.
%
% *8.* Turn the vehicle switch off.
%


%% Task 5 - Simulate Closed-Loop Control Model
%
% *1.* Open the <matlab:arduinouno_drive_closedloop model>. Observe
% two subsystems in the model.
%
% *2.* Double-click *PID Controller* subsystem. Notice that the
% proportional (P) control is used to synchronize two motors when the
% vehicle runs straight. Also, notice that during a turn, no
% synchronization is applied.
%
% *3.* Click *Start simulation* in the Simulink toolbar. Click the *Scope*
% block and observe that the *Encoder Output Mismatch* remains close to
% zero. This indicates that the vehicle will skew less compared to the
% *Open Loop Control* model.

%% Task 6 - Run Closed-Loop Control Model on the Arduino Uno Board
%
% *1.* Disconnect the battery power wire leading to the Vin terminal on the
% Arduino Uno board since the board will get powered via a USB cable.
% 
% *2.* Connect the Arduino Uno board to your host computer using USB
% cable.
% 
% *3.* Select *Tools > Run on Target Hardware > Run* to download the
% example model.
% 
% *4.* After the model is downloaded, disconnect the USB cable from your
% Arduino Uno board. 
% 
% *5.* Connect back the battery power wire leading to the Vin terminal on
% your Arduino Uno board.
% 
% *6.* Place the vehicle on the ground and turn the vehicle switch on. The
% model runs on the board and the vehicle starts moving.
%
% *7.* Observe that the path of the vehicle is straighter, as predicted
% by the simulation.
%
% *8.* Turn the vehicle switch off.
%


%% Other Things to Try
% 
% * Adjust the *PID Controller* settings. Improve the vehicle's ability to
% move straight on a rough or tilted surface.

%% Summary
%
% This example showed how to simulate and implement a basic closed-loop
% controller on an Arduino Uno board. In the example you learned that:
% 
% * Open-Loop Control does not ensure straight driving in a vehicle with
% independently powered wheels.
% * Closed-Loop Control uses the difference between two encoder outputs to
% calculate the power that should be applied to each wheel individually.
% * Both simulated and actual hardware may be used in the same model,
% provided that a mechanism for switching between them exists.
